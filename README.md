# Vin32

Run your old Windows executables on modern systems. Will be written with V language. (under construction)

Inspired from [retrowin32](https://github.com/evmar/retrowin32).

## Status

Vin32 has parse some PE32 EXE opcodes, but it can't emulate them currently.

I use [7-Zip 9.20 EXE (32-bit)](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z920.exe) for development testing.
